# League Mod Repather

**A standalone tool to automatically fix League of Legends mods after game updates.**

When Riot Games updates League of Legends, old mods often stop working. This tool **automatically updates your mods** to work with the latest game version by "repathing" them.

**In simple terms:** It fixes broken mods so they work again! ✨
